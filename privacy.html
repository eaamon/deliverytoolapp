        Delivery Tool only shares Google Sheets data that you explicitly submit through the add-on. Shared data may include order details, recipient names, and addresses. This data is sent only to the delivery providers you select within the add-on (e.g., FedEx, UPS, DHL) for the purpose of order fulfillment. Delivery Tool does not sell or share your data with any other parties.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some optional features may use third-party services to enhance functionality. In these cases, only the specific data you provide for that feature is shared. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third-party services. Please review their privacy policies before using them.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Security</h2>
