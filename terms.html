      <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
      <p>
        Please read these Terms & Conditions carefully before using the Delivery
        Tool add-on for Google Sheets™.
      </p>
    </header>

    <main>
      <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>
        By installing or using the Delivery Tool add-on ("the Add-on"), you
        agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms & Conditions. If you do
        not agree, do not use the Add-on.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Data Handling and Sheet Integrity</h2>
      <p>
        The Add-on operates within your existing Google Sheets™ environment.
        Your data is <strong>not deleted or erased</strong> when the Add-on is
        applied. However, improper configuration or unauthorized modifications
        to linked platforms may cause technical issues, including failure to
        receive new orders or sync data correctly. The developer is not
        responsible for any data loss or service interruption resulting from
        misconfiguration or third-party service errors.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Payment and Activation</h2>
      <p>
        Full functionality of the Add-on is available only after payment has
        been confirmed. Users must send payment proof (receipt) either to the
        official Delivery Tool support email or via direct contact with the
        developer. Until confirmation, certain features or automation functions
        may remain disabled.
      </p>

      <h2>4. License and Usage</h2>
      <p>
        Delivery Tool grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited
        license to use the Add-on for personal or business use. You may not
        copy, modify, distribute, or resell the Add-on without written
        permission.
      </p>

      <h2>5. User Responsibilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Ensure that the Add-on is properly configured according to setup
          instructions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Verify that your Google Sheets™ and linked store platforms are
          functioning correctly before activation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the Add-on in compliance with all applicable laws and Google’s
          terms of service.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Limitations of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        Delivery Tool is provided “as is,” without warranties of any kind. The
        developer is not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or
        consequential damages arising from the use or inability to use the
        Add-on, including loss of data, revenue, or business operations.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Updates and Modifications</h2>
      <p>
        The developer reserves the right to update, modify, or discontinue the
        Add-on at any time without prior notice. Continued use after updates
        constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms & Conditions.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Third-Party Integrations</h2>
      <p>
        The Add-on may connect to third-party services (such as delivery
        providers or e-commerce platforms). Delivery Tool is not responsible for
        failures, delays, or errors caused by third-party systems.
      </p>
